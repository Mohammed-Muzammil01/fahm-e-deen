                    <h2>Understanding Deen by Gaining Knowledge & Pleasing Allah SWT</h2>
                    <p>
                        Islam is the religion of knowledge. The first ayah of the Qur’an enjoined reading which is the key to knowledge. Allah says: “Read! In the Name of your Lord Who has created (all that exists). He has created man from a clot (a piece of thick coagulated blood). Read! And your Lord is the Most Generous. Who has taught (the writing) by the pen. He has taught man that which he knew not.” (Qur’an, 96:1-5)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In Islam, knowledge comes before action; there can be no action without knowledge.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The scholars occupy a noble status in Islam, and which is higher than the position of others in this world and in the Hereafter.
                    </p>
                    <h3 className="quran">“Allah will exalt in degree those of you who believe, and those who have been granted knowledge.”</h3>
                    <p className="quran">Qur'an,58:11</p>
                    <p>Allah praises the scholars, as He says:</p>
                    <h3 className="quran">“Are those who know equal to those who know not?’ It is only men of understanding who will remember (i.e. get a lesson from Allah’s Signs and Verses).”</h3>
                    <p className="quran">Qur’an, 39:9</p>
                    <p>Islam calls us to seek knowledge as the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said:</p>
                    <h3 className="quran">“Seeking knowledge is a duty upon every Muslim.”</h3>
                    <p className="quran">Sunan of Ibn Majah, Vol. 1, Book 1, Hadith 224</p>
                    <p>
                        He (peace and blessings be upon him) explained that the superiority of the one who has knowledge over the one who merely worships is like the superiority of the moon over every other heavenly body.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He (peace and blessings be upon him) said that the scholars are the heirs of the prophets and that the prophets did not leave behind dinars and dirhams, rather their inheritance was knowledge, so whoever acquires it has gained a great share. And he (peace and blessings be upon him) said that seeking knowledge is a way to paradise. He (peace and blessings be upon him) said: “Whoever follows a path in the pursuit of knowledge, Allah will make a path to paradise easy for him.” (Al-Bukhari, Kitab Al-Ilm, 10)</p>
                    <p>
                        Our goal is to impart various sciences of Shariah through which man comes to know his Lord and His Prophet and religion.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Prophet (peace be upon him) said:
                    </p>
                    <h3 className="quran">“When Allah wishes good for a person, He makes him understand the religion.”</h3>
                    <p className="quran">Al-Bukhari, 69</p>
                    <p>
                        When one gains the knowledge and deep understanding of deen, he attains the sound heart and the moral character that is required of him, as Allah ta’ala states that it is the only thing that will prove beneficial on the day of judgment:
                    </p>
                    <h3 className="quran">“The Day (of judgment is the one) when neither wealth nor sons will be of any benefit, But only he (will prosper) that brings to Allah a sound heart”</h3>
                    <p className="quran">Quran: 88-89</p>
